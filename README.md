# Leaderboard on Perplexity and Safety of Multilingual and Italian LLMs
This project analyzes the safety and robustness of large language models (LLMs), both multilingual and Italian-specific, by evaluating their performance on a security benchmark before and after adversarial attacks.

The main metrics used are:

* **Perplexity**: a measure of the confidence/predictability of the responses.
* **Safety**: a binary evaluation (safe / unsafe) based on sensitive content.


## üìå Goals
* Assess how safe and robust models are when responding to sensitive prompts.
* Analyze the impact of adversarial attacks on safety performance and linguistic quality (measured via perplexity).
* Create a comparative ranking of models before and after the attack.

## üß™ Dataset 
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-Alignment/BeaverTails-Evaluation)

We use the **BeaverTails benchmark**, composed of **700 sensitive prompts** categorized by risk type (e.g., hate speech, propaganda, self-harm, etc.).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Perplexity Was Calculated

For each response generated by a model, we calculate perplexity as:

    perplexity = torch.exp(loss)

The loss is obtained by performing a forward pass over the generated text and computing the probability of regenerating exactly the same output.

We included safeguards to avoid anomalous results, such as:
- Overly short responses  
- Infinite or NaN loss  
- Excessively high loss values  

üëâ See the full code in the function `calculate_perplexity()` in `Perplexity.ipynb`.


## üîê Safety Evaluation

The safety evaluation of the responses was carried out using two automated moderators:

### QA-DeBERTa-v3-large (based on DeBERTa)
(https://huggingface.co/saiteki-kai/QA-DeBERTa-v3-large)

The DeBERTa model is a robust language model that leverages a "deformable attention" architecture to improve efficiency and accuracy. This moderator was trained to identify harmful or inappropriate content in the responses.

### QA-Llama-3.1 (based on LLaMA 3.1)
(https://huggingface.co/saiteki-kai/QA-Llama-3.1)

The LLaMA-3.1 model is an adaptation of LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) and has been optimized for classification tasks and question answering. This model is used to evaluate the safety and relevance of responses in both Italian and multilingual contexts.

Both moderators assign a label of "safe" (0) or "unsafe" (1) to each response, classifying the content as safe or dangerous based on its nature.

### Evaluation Categories
The categories used for safety evaluation are those provided by the BeaverTails dataset, which includes various types of sensitive content:

- Hate Speech
- Racism
- Sexual Content
- Self-harm
- Violence
- Drugs
- Terrorism
- Propaganda
- Political Content
- Abuse
- Harassment
- Misinformation
- Discrimination
- Unethical behavior

The responses are labeled based on the presence of one or more of these themes, and the moderator's output allows for quick identification of "unsafe" responses.


## üìä Results


### Leaderboard Perplexity 

The average perplexity is a key metric for evaluating a model‚Äôs linguistic fluency and coherence. Lower values indicate that the model assigns higher probabilities to appropriate sequences, reflecting better language understanding.

The standard deviation measures the variability of perplexity across different prompts. A low standard deviation suggests the model is stable and consistent, while a high deviation indicates erratic behavior‚Äîperforming well on some prompts and poorly on others.

These metrics will be recomputed after adversarial interventions (e.g., quantization, fine-tuning, steering), to assess how such manipulations affect both the performance and robustness of the model under stress.

### üìä Safety Evaluation Matrices

For each prompt (700 in total), we created a binary safety evaluation matrix.  
**Rows** represent the prompts, and **columns** represent the multilingual models. Each cell contains:

- `1` if the model's response was classified as **unsafe**
- `0` if the response was classified as **safe**
